LatexInComments (*laic*) is an Emacs package that provides interactive
functions to render $\LaTeX$ math blocks in code comments.

It has been tested in C++, Lua and elisp, but should work out of the
box in any programming mode supported

* Examples

* Description

*laic* identifies raw LaTeX blocks in comments, calls LaTeX under the
hood to produce output images, and renders them as overlays.

- The interactive function *laic-create-overlay-from-latex-inside-or-forward* render current or next LaTeX block as an overlay
- The interactive function *laic-create-overlays-from-comment-inside* renders all blocks in current comment
- The interactive function *laic-remove-overlays* removes/hides all overlays
- Temporary files are stored in the customizable *laic-output-dir* relative to current file path

* Installation

laic can only be installed through direct download, at the
moment. Just copy [[file:laic.el]] to your local lisp folder and require
it in your init.el

The following elisp block adds a hook to all programming modes that
loads *laic* and sets up keybindings for the most relevant interactive
functions.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook
   (function
    (lambda ()
     (require 'laic)
     ;; render current or next LaTeX block (same keybinding as org-latex-preview)
     (local-set-key (kbd "C-c C-x C-l") 'laic-create-overlay-from-latex-inside-or-forward)
     ;; render all blocks in current comment
     (local-set-key (kbd "C-c c") 'laic-create-overlays-from-comment-inside)
     ;; disable all laic overlays
     (local-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'laic-remove-overlays))))
#+END_SRC
